## RISC based MYTH
RISC based MYTH (microprocessor for you in thirty hours) is a workshop which helps us build a RISC-V processor in 5 days.This RISC-V processor is designed with the help of Transaction Level Verilog (TLVerilog) made use in MakerChip IDE platform.
In this workshop, we will be working from Day 3 onwards.
### DAY 3
#### Digital logic with TL-Verilog and Makerchip
##### Combinational logic in TL-Verilog and mackerchip
**Basic logic gates:**

The following are basic combinational logic in TL-Verilog:

1.Inverter:
  - Navigate under TLV Section and type:
        ```$out = ~ $in```
  - Compile by clicking on ``` E ``` on the top right corner
    
2.XOR gate:

3.Vector:

##### Validity
* Addding validity makes it easier to debug.
* It provides a cleaner design.
* Automatic clock gating.
